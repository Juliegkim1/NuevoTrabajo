Unlike reductions in available special and trust funds, there is no automatic 
appropriation of this authority in the following year. Treasury processes a warrant 
reducing fund balance in the expenditure account and increasing fund balance in the 
associated unavailable receipt account. Also post USSGL TC-A185 in the 
unavailable special or trust fund receipt account. Credit USSGL account 299100 if 
fund withdrawal does not occur simultaneously. For withdrawal of funds, see

been passed when the goods are received. Also post USSGL TCs G120, G122, and 
G124 to track purchases. For payroll and benefits, see USSGL TC-E102. For "in-
process type" accounts and assisted acquisition situations, see USSGL TC-D514. 
Due to the reconciliation of interagency expenses and revenues, agencies first must 
record all direct costs to a USSGL account 600000 expense series account and then 
offset those amounts using USSGL account 661000 when the costs are capitalized to 
the appropriate type asset account. For other payroll related transactions, see 
USSGL TCs-E104 through E117. Record USSGL account 219000 for grants 
payable.

             Comment:     If funded by a direct appropriation, also post TC-B134. For payroll and benefits, see 
USSGL TC-E102. Assume a title has been passed when the goods are received. 
Also post USSGL TCs G120, G122, and G124 to track purchases. For "in-process 
type" accounts and assisted acquisition situations, see USSGL TC-D514. Due to the 
reconciliation of interagency expenses and revenues, agencies must first record all 
direct costs to a USSGL account 600000 expense series account and then offset 
those amounts using USSGL account 661000 when the costs are capitalized to the 
appropriate type asset account. For other payroll related transactions, see USSGL

C124    To record the maturity of Federal securities acquired at a discount by a Treasury Appropriation 
Fund Symbol (TAFS) other than a nonfiduciary deposit fund. 
             Comment:     Prior to maturity, an entry is made to complete the amortization of a discount. The 
budgetary entry shows the purchase discount is realized as a budgetary resource 
when the security matures. Special and trust funds use USSGL account 411400. If 
budgetary resources were previously anticipated, revolving funds credit USSGL 
account 407000 and special and trust funds credit USSGL account 412000. Also 
post USSGL TC-A122 if authority was previously anticipated and apportioned or 
USSGL TCA123 if authority was previously anticipated in programs exempt from 
apportionment. Fiduciary deposit funds would not record the budgetary entry. See 
USSGL TC-A195, TC-C109, or TC-C140 to record the collection of interest 
received on the maturity. See USSGL TC-C128 to record the maturity of a U.S. 
Treasury Zero Coupon Bond issued by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. See USSGL 
TC-C125 for securities acquired at a discount by nonfiduciary deposit fund that 
matured.

C420    To record accrued revenue or other financing sources without budgetary impact. 
             Comment:     Receivables from non-Federal sources are not budgetary resources until collected. 
This transaction should be used if you have a receivable recorded from a transaction 
with nonfiduciary deposit funds. For receivables reported for non-Federal custodial 
collections, also post USSGL TC -C404. For Federal and non-Federal receivables 
reported in a General Fund receipt account, also post USSGL TC-C405. See USSGL 
TC-F124 for the preclosing adjusting entry recorded at yearend. 
             Reference:     OMB Circular No. A-11, the Budget totals exclude amounts from deposit fund 
transactions because the funds are not owned by the Government. Therefore, the 
budget records transactions between deposit funds and budgetary accounts as 
transactions with public. Other USSGL Guidance: Accounting and Reporting

C430    To record an old motor vehicle that was traded in for a new motor vehicle using the direct method. 
             Comment:     This entry is to show a trade-in only. An entry for indirect cost is not included. This 
is the way the Department of Defense accounts for repairable items involving trade-
ins. Accounts receivable represents the cash amount the vehicle procurer will 
receive from the customer. Inventory held for repair represents the value of an asset 
after it is repaired (value of a similar new asset). Other financing source represents 
fair market value of the old vehicle. Other financing source was used instead of 
revenue from goods sold due to a trade-in, which is not a budgetary resource. 
Inventory allowance represents the estimated repair cost of the damaged vehicle.

C610    To record the sale or disposition of personal property collected for replacement property. 
             Comment:     Sales proceeds on disposed personal property collected for a replacement property 
will have no budgetary entry until the obligation is subsequently incurred for the 
replacement property. In most cases, the proceeds will only be available for 
acquisition of the replacement property in the fiscal year that the old property was 
sold, then for 1 fiscal year thereafter. This entry may not be applicable to some 
agencies that have specific language in their legislation that allows them to keep the 
proceeds beyond 2 years. See USSGL implementation guidance, "Disposition of 
Personal Property" on the USSGL Website. Also review CFR 41, chapter 101 and 
GAO's Policy and Procedure Manual, dated May 1993, pages 7.5-8.9.

D108    To record a downward adjustment to prior-year paid delivered orders and to collect a refund when 
the adjustment is not recorded as a prior-period adjustment (USSGL account 740000 or 740100). 
             Comment:     Prior-year adjustments are used only in year 2 and later. The offset to all downward 
adjustments to undelivered orders is anticipated recoveries. If such a transaction 
causes an abnormal credit balance, approval by the Office of Management and 
Budget for use of resources is required. If anticipated accounts are not used, credit 
USSGL account 445000 or 462000. Also post USSGL TC-A122 if authority was 
previously anticipated and apportioned or USSGL TC-A123 if authority was 
previously anticipated in programs exempt from apportionment. Reverse USSGL 
TC-B134 for direct appropriations. For a prior-period adjustment (USSGL account 
740000 or 740100), see USSGL TCs D306, D308, D310, and D312.

Expended authority is less than the original obligation and the authority is not expired. 
             Comment:     The offset to downward adjustments to undelivered orders is anticipated recoveries. 
If such a transaction causes an abnormal credit balance, the Office of Management 
and Budget's approval for use of resources is required. When anticipated accounts 
are not used, credit USSGL account 445000 or credit USSGL account 462000 if 
funds are exempt from apportionment. Also post USSGL TC-B134 if funded by a 
direct appropriation. Also post USSGL TC-A122 if recoveries were previously 
anticipated and apportioned or USSGL TC-A123 if recoveries were previously 
anticipated in programs exempt from apportionment. The payroll and related benefit 
liabilities in this transaction are only for work-in-process. For other payroll-related 
transactions, see USSGL TCs-E104 through E117. Also post USSGL TCs G120, 
G122, and G124 to track purchases.
